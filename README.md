# Recurrent-Neural-Networks
This repository contains an implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for author classification based on writing style. The project simulates a real-world data analytics task for a large book press, where a bot is developed to predict authorship from text samples.
