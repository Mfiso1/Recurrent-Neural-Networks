# Recurrent-Neural-Networks

This repository implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for author classification based on writing style. The project simulates a real-world data analytics task for a large book press, where a bot is developed to predict authorship from text samples.

## Workflow

The project follows a structured workflow:

- **Dataset Evaluation**: Assessing the suitability of the dataset for LSTM modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to understand patterns and characteristics.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant text features for model training.
- **Model Training**: Configuring and training the LSTM model with selected hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation**: Interpreting model performance using accuracy, loss curves, and other metrics.
- **Iterative Retraining**: Adjusting parameters and retraining to optimize results.
- **Reporting**: Documenting the entire pipeline—from data preparation to model interpretation—demonstrating how deep learning can be applied to author style prediction.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to showcase the application of LSTM RNNs for sequential text analysis, highlighting how deep learning techniques can extract predictive insights from writing style data.
